## 📸 Example

You can visualize a dashboard like this:

```
+----------------+------------------------------+-----------+
| Author         | Comment                      | Sentiment |
+----------------+------------------------------+-----------+
| John Doe       | This video is amazing!       | Good      |
| Jane Smith     | Waste of time. Don’t watch.  | Bad       |
+----------------+------------------------------+-----------+
```

## 🤖 AI Classification Logic

Each comment is sent to Gemini with the following prompt:

> Classify this comment as either "Good" (positive/neutral) or "Bad" (negative/abusive/offensive/harsh). Return only "Good" or "Bad".

---

## 📥 Output

After classification, a file `labeled_comments.csv` is created with:

| Author     | Comment                            | Sentiment |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| John Doe   | This video is amazing!              | Good      |
| Jane Smith | Waste of time. Don’t watch it.      | Bad       |
